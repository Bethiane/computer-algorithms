### Counting operations method in Big O
with this method we measure the perfomance of our algorithm by counting number of operations instead of manually timing it 
becoue the number of operations in your code is easy to standadize and remains consistend regaldless of computer, compared to manually timing our code

so lets count operations in function `sumUpTo`

first method with `3` operations ( multiplication, adddition and division)

second method with `1 * N` operations ( one addition operation which will be repeated Nth time )
